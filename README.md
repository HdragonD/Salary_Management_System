Salary Management System 

This project is done by me in the first trimester of my PGDM in Big Data Analytics from AIDTM.
This project is made in order to understand how a person can obtain insights from a database which consists of various information related to the employees of a particular organization.
In this project, I have used data generated by AI.
No real data is used in creation of this database.
I have used 4 tables having metadata as follows:
Table 1: “employees”
	Metadata: employeeid, firstname, lastname, email, hiredate

Table 2: “salaries”
	Metadata: salaryid, employeeid, salaryamont, salarydate

Table 3: “departments”
	Metadata: departmentid, departmentname

Table 4: “employeedepartment”
	Metadata: employeeid, departmentid

Hope this information helps as many people as possible.
Cheers..!!
